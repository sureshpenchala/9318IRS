## Overview 

### This repository contains scripts and data to reproduce the results of the paper titled, "Controlled Wireless Channel using Multi-Antenna Multi-IRS Assisted Communication System: A Comprehensive Performance Analysis". This study evaluates the performance of a multi-antenna, multi-IRS-assisted communication system in generalized η-μ fading channels under NLOS conditions. It derives theoretical expressions for BER, Ergodic Capacity, and Energy Efficiency, validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. Results show significant performance improvements with multiple IRSs, optimized placement, and additional antennas, offering enhanced reliability, capacity, and energy efficiency for future communication systems.


## The key features of the Paper

- **IRS-Assisted Communication**: Utilizes intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) with reconfigurable metamaterials to manipulate wireless propagation channels cost-effectively.
- **Generalized Fading Analysis**: Analyzes system performance under generalized η-μ fading channels, covering Nakagami-m, Nakagami-q, and Rayleigh channels as special cases for practical scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Derives theoretical expressions for Bit Error Rate (BER), Ergodic Capacity (EC), and Energy Efficiency (EE), validated through Monte Carlo simulations.
- **System Design Insights**: Demonstrates improved performance with more antennas, multiple IRSs, optimized IRS placement (near BS or UE), high μ, and low η values.
- **Significant Gains**: Highlights substantial gains in BER, EC, and EE for triple-IRS systems and multi-antenna setups compared to single-IRS configurations.
- **Optimization Benefits**: Shows that strategic placement of IRSs reduces BER, enhances capacity, and boosts energy efficiency.
